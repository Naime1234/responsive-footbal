    <p class="pargraph"> After a thrilling few weeks of international football the Russia 2018 World Cup has finally come to end with France crowned winners and adding a second star above their badge. The final saw them overcome Croatia in an exciting, slightly controversial but ultimately enjoyable match which meant the results in our World Cup Sweepstake were determined. <p class="pargraph">

        Well done to winner Rudy Roche for choosing France and to runner-up Tom Battye for his choice of Croatia.</p>
        
        <p class="pargraph">  Thank you for your support.</b>  </p></p>
